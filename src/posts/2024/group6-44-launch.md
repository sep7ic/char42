i was really excited to watch the starlink mission group 6-44 launch!! while waiting, i doodled a previous falcon 9 block 5 launch (starlink V1.0 L16) and then doodled another falcon 9 block 5 (this time it was a close up of between the first and interstages)

unfortunately, 1 minute and 27 seconds before planned liftoff, it was scrubbed!! according to the 45th weather squadron, there was low-to-moderate risk of upper-level wind shear (whatever the hell that means. i dont understand weather jargon at all.), so the new launch time is scheduled for Thu Mar 14th, 2024, 9:39 PM - 11:29PM EDT.
